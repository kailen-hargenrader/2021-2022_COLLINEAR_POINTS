 *   Given a point p, the following method determines 
 *   whether p participates in a set of 4 or more collinear points.
 *   Think of p as the origin.
 *   - For each other point q, determine the slope it makes with p.
 *   - Sort the points according to the slopes they makes with p.
 *   - Check if any 3 (or more) adjacent points in 
 *      the sorted order have equal slopes with respect to p. 
 *      If so, these points, together with p, are collinear.
